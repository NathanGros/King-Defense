# King-Defense
A chess inspired Tower defense game, made in Java with Raylib.

Black spawns enemies (black pieces) during waves. These enemies will try to hurt your white king.

To stop them, you can place towers (white pieces) with special abilities, and collect coins when the enemies die.

With these, you can buy upgrades, survive longer and repeat !
