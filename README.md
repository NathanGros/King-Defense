# King-Defense
A chess inspired Tower defense game

The ennemy (black) spawns ennemies (black pieces) during waves. These ennemies will try to hurt your white king.

To stop them, you can place towers (white pieces) with special abilities, and collect coins when the ennemies die.

With these, you can buy upgrades, survive longer and repeat !
